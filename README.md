## Digital Empowerment Community of Austin

DigitalATX.org is a web-based tool for knowledge sharing and creating an inventory of assets for digital inclusion programming in Austin. It is the a community-based resource for documenting programs and site locations within the Digital Empowerment Community of Austin.

### Knowledge-Sharing: How Does It Work?
The knowledge-sharing portion of DigitalATX.org is key resource for tracking public access computer labs, private labs that may be available for programming, and digital literacy training programs in Austin. Navigate to the Lab Profiles tab to view documented Lab Profiles detailing public computer labs, libraries, schools and more. Information captured for each Lab Profile includes number of computers available for use, assistive technology, availability of on-site trainers and more. Programs operating at specific sites can be added to each Lab Profile to track which nonprofit organizations or leveraging which locations in Austin for digital inclusion programming.


### Knowledge-Sharing: How Can I Help?
This inventory of programs and site locations in Austin is only as strong as the collective knowledge within the Digital Empowerment Community of Austin. Numerous organizations are currently providing programming throughout the city, but more work is needed to ensure all Austin residents have access to the resources and training needed to build digital skills. Creating a comprehensive and living inventory of resources will help all organizations in Austin improve and potentially expand their service delivery. But to accomplish this, we need all organizations to ensure their knowledge is captured.
